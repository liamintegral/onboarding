# Development Log - July 14, 2025

## Project Initialization

### Overview
Started development of the Client Onboarding Dashboard for digital marketing agency. This system will help clients connect their various platforms (Google, Meta, TikTok, LinkedIn, CMS, DNS, hosting) with AI-powered technical assistance.

### Completed Tasks

#### 1. Project Structure Setup ‚úÖ
- Created main project directory: `/Users/liamclarkin/ClaudeCode Projects/Onboarding Dashboard`
- Organized folders:
  - `frontend/` - Dashboard UI components
  - `backend/` - API server and business logic
  - `database/` - Database schemas and migrations
  - `Documentation/` - All project documentation
    - `planning/` - Architecture and design documents
    - `devlog/` - Development progress logs
    - `instructions/` - Setup and deployment guides

#### 2. Documentation Foundation ‚úÖ
- **CLAUDE.md**: Created comprehensive instructions file for consistent AI assistance across multiple Claude Code instances
- **architecture.md**: Detailed system architecture with tech stack, database schema, API endpoints, and security considerations

#### 3. Claude Code Integration Strategy ‚úÖ
Established best practices for working with multiple Claude Code instances:
- CLAUDE.md serves as the single source of truth
- Devlog tracks progress and current status
- Todo list management for task coordination
- Clear project structure and naming conventions

### Current Status

#### Todo List
1. ‚úÖ Create project structure in Onboarding Dashboard folder
2. üîÑ Set up Documentation folder with planning files (in progress)
3. ‚úÖ Create CLAUDE.md file for consistent AI instructions
4. ‚è∏Ô∏è Initialize project with package.json and basic structure
5. ‚è∏Ô∏è Create backend API server with AI integration
6. ‚è∏Ô∏è Build dashboard UI with navigation and sections
7. ‚è∏Ô∏è Implement AI chat assistant for technical support
8. ‚è∏Ô∏è Create progress tracking system for platform connections
9. ‚è∏Ô∏è Add real-time status updates and notifications
10. ‚è∏Ô∏è Implement authentication and client data persistence
11. ‚è∏Ô∏è Create admin panel for agency team

### Next Steps
1. Complete documentation setup with user stories and API specifications
2. Initialize package.json files for both frontend and backend
3. Set up development environment with necessary dependencies
4. Create basic project scaffolding and folder structure
5. Begin backend API development with express server setup

### Technical Decisions Made

#### Architecture Choices
- **Frontend**: React or vanilla JS with modern ES6 modules
- **Backend**: Node.js with Express.js framework
- **Database**: SQLite for development, PostgreSQL for production
- **AI Integration**: OpenAI GPT-4 primary, Anthropic Claude secondary
- **Real-time**: Socket.io for WebSocket connections

#### Project Organization
- Monorepo structure with separate frontend/backend folders
- Comprehensive documentation strategy
- Claude Code instance coordination via CLAUDE.md
- Version control ready (Git integration planned)

### Challenges and Considerations
1. **AI Context Management**: Need to maintain conversation history and platform context
2. **Security**: Secure credential handling without storing platform passwords
3. **Scalability**: Design for 100+ concurrent clients
4. **User Experience**: Make technical processes accessible to non-technical users

### Environment Setup Required
```bash
# Required environment variables
OPENAI_API_KEY=
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=
DATABASE_URL=sqlite://./database/onboarding.db
JWT_SECRET=
SESSION_SECRET=
NODE_ENV=development
PORT=3001
FRONTEND_URL=http://localhost:3000
```

### Notes for Future Claude Instances
- Always read CLAUDE.md first for project context
- Check this devlog for latest progress
- Update todo list status when making changes
- Document significant decisions and changes
- Follow established project structure and naming conventions
