# Claude Code Instructions for Onboarding Dashboard Project

## Project Overview
This is a LIVE, fully-deployed client onboarding dashboard system for a digital marketing agency. The system helps clients connect their various platforms (Google, Meta, TikTok, LinkedIn, CMS, DNS, hosting) with AI assistance for technical challenges.

🚀 **PRODUCTION DEPLOYMENT**: https://onboarding-dashboard-nine.vercel.app/

## Architecture (COMPLETED & DEPLOYED)
- **Frontend**: React 18 application with routing, authentication, and responsive design
- **Backend**: Vercel serverless functions with Supabase PostgreSQL
- **Database**: Supabase PostgreSQL with complete schema and seeded data
- **Authentication**: JWT-based auth with protected routes
- **Deployment**: Vercel with automatic GitHub integration

## Current Development Status: ENHANCED UX FLOWS ✅
**Project Status**: LIVE WITH APPLE-STYLE SETUP FLOWS
**Last Updated**: July 15, 2025
**Deployment**: Production-ready on Vercel with new Google flows
**Database**: Fully configured with seeded data
**Frontend**: React dashboard with elegant setup experiences
**Backend**: All API endpoints deployed and tested

### Recent Achievements (July 15, 2025)
- ✅ Created 5 Apple-style Google property setup components
- ✅ Implemented seamless progressive flow (My Business → Tag Manager → Search Console → Analytics → Ads)
- ✅ Added robust navigation system with back/cancel functionality
- ✅ Enhanced WordPress setup with navigation controls
- ✅ Added step indicators showing "Google Setup: Step X of 5"
- ✅ Fixed routing to prevent old wizard from appearing after new flows
- ✅ Added quick setup buttons for manual platform access

### Previous Achievements (July 14, 2025)
- ✅ Full-stack application deployed to production
- ✅ React frontend with authentication working perfectly
- ✅ All API endpoints functional
- ✅ Database schema complete with platform types seeded
- ✅ Responsive design confirmed working
- ✅ Git repository properly configured

## Current Known Issues (July 15, 2025)

### 🐛 **CRITICAL BUG: Platform Setup Wizard Still Appears**
- **Problem**: After completing WordPress setup, old platform wizard sometimes still shows
- **Root Cause**: OnboardingWizard routing logic needs complete validation
- **Fix Applied**: Updated handleWebsiteAnalysisComplete to detect new flow completion
- **Status**: NEEDS TESTING - may require additional routing fixes
- **Workaround**: Users can use "Google Properties" quick setup button

### 🔍 **Detection Logic Inconsistency**  
- **Problem**: Automatic Google flow detection may not trigger reliably
- **Impact**: Users may not see new Apple-style flows automatically
- **Workaround**: Added manual "🏢 Google Properties" button in website analysis
- **Future Fix**: Enhance website analysis detection algorithms

## Next Session Priorities
1. **🚨 HIGH PRIORITY**: Test and fix OnboardingWizard routing completely
2. **🚨 HIGH PRIORITY**: Verify end-to-end Google property flow works without old wizard interference
3. **📊 MEDIUM**: Improve automatic technology detection in website analysis
4. **🎨 LOW**: Apply Apple-style design to remaining platforms (Meta, LinkedIn, TikTok)

## Working with Multiple Claude Instances
1. Always read this CLAUDE.md file first
2. Note that the project has ELEGANT SETUP FLOWS but ONE ROUTING BUG
3. Check the live site: https://onboarding-dashboard-nine.vercel.app/
4. Focus on TESTING the complete Google flow and fixing any wizard routing issues
5. Any new features should build on the Apple-style design patterns established
6. Update this file if making significant architectural changes

## Important Notes
- ✅ This is a COMPLETED defensive security project for client onboarding
- ✅ All security best practices implemented (JWT auth, CORS, input validation)
- ✅ Production-ready with proper error handling
- ✅ Client data protection measures in place
