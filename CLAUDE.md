# Claude Code Instructions for Onboarding Dashboard Project

## Project Overview
This is a LIVE, fully-deployed client onboarding dashboard system for a digital marketing agency. The system helps clients connect their various platforms (Google, Meta, TikTok, LinkedIn, CMS, DNS, hosting) with AI assistance for technical challenges.

ðŸš€ **PRODUCTION DEPLOYMENT**: https://onboarding-dashboard-nine.vercel.app/

## Architecture (COMPLETED & DEPLOYED)
- **Frontend**: React 18 application with routing, authentication, and responsive design
- **Backend**: Vercel serverless functions with Supabase PostgreSQL
- **Database**: Supabase PostgreSQL with complete schema and seeded data
- **Authentication**: JWT-based auth with protected routes
- **Deployment**: Vercel with automatic GitHub integration
